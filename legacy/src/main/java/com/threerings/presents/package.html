    A framework for sharing data between network-connected applications and a
    remote procedure call mechanism.

    The normal configuration of the Presents system is client/server; generally
    with many clients connecting to a single server though a system exists to
    allow a network of peer servers to communicate with one another . All
    information transfer takes place through the server using the distributed
    object system documented below.

    <p> For libraries that are build on the distributed object services as well
    as most code in a system using the distributed object services, everything
    you need are in these packages: </p>

    <ul>
    <li><a href="annotation/package-summary.html">annotation</a> - annotations
        used for dependency resolution, distributed object defintion and
        documentation purposes.
    <li><a href="dobj/package-summary.html">dobj</a> - the core of the
        distributed object system.
    <li><a href="tools/package-summary.html">tools</a> - ant tasks for
        generating ditsributed object setter methods, invocation service and
        invocation receiver marshallers.
    <li><a href="util/package-summary.html">util</a> - various utilities that
        simplify life for users of the distributed object services.
    </ul>

    <p> Systems making use of the distributed object services will need to set
    up a client and server. The following packages contain those services and
    their implementation: </p>

    <ul>
    <li><a href="client/package-summary.html">client</a> - the client side of
        the distributed object client/server framework.
    <li><a href="data/package-summary.html">data</a> - classes that are sent
        over the network (and hence shared by the client and server); constant
        definition interfaces.
    <li><a href="net/package-summary.html">net</a> - classes used to define and
        implement the Presents protocol.
    <li><a href="server/package-summary.html">server</a> - the server side of
        the distributed object client/server framework.
    </ul>

    <p> Systems that need to scale beyond a single server will need to make use
    of services in the peer package which provides a mechanism by which
    multiple servers can operate in concert. </p>
